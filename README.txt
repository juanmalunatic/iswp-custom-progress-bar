Version: 1.0.2

This plugin enables a custom progress bar that will be displayed in the user's
profile, and the management of the steps associated with said bar.

This bar's steps consist on completing LearnDash courses/quizzes, a manually
set-up payment, and a (Gravity) form.

Additionally, the plugin sets up a cron job to remind certificate-holders
to renew their payments at certain frequencies (for example, 6 months
before their payment expires).

I suggest pairing this plugin with WP Crontrol and WP Mail Logging in order
to have a more in depth overview of how many mails are being sent and
their content.
